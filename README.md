# Predicting-Housing-Prices
 In this project, we implement data analysis using python. We will analyse and predict housing prices using various attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors and so on.
 We will pre-process our data and then understand it better by applying exploratory data analysis. We will then build a linear regression model to predict the price.
